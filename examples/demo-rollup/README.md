# Demo Rollup

This is a demo full node running a simple Sovereign SDK rollup on [Celestia](https://celestia.org/).

## What is it?

This demo shows how to integrate a state-transition function with a DA layer and a Zkvm to create a full
zk-rollup. The code in this repository corresponds to running a full-node of the rollup, which executes
every transaction. If you want to see the logic for _proof generation_, check out the [demo-prover](../demo-prover/)
package instead.

By swapping out or modifying the imported state transition function, you can customize
this example full-node to run arbitrary logic.

## How to Customize This Example

Any time you change out the state transition function, ZKVM, or DA layer of your rollup, you'll
need to tweak this full-node code. At the very least, you'll need to modify the dependencies. In most cases,
your full node will also need to be aware of the STF's initialization logic, and how it exposes RPC.

Given that constraint, we won't try to give you specific instructions for supporting every imaginable
combination of DA layers and State Transition Functions. Instead, we'll explain at a high level what
tasks a full-node needs to accomplish.

### Step 1: Initialize the DA Service

The first _mandatory_ step is to initialize a DA service, which allows the full node implementation to
communicate with the DA layer's RPC endpoints.

If you're using Celestia as your DA layer, you can follow the instructions at the end
of this document to set up a local full node, or connect to
a remote node. Whichever option you pick, simply place the connection
information in the `rollup_config.toml` file and it will be
automatically picked up by the node implementation.

### Step 2: Initialize the State Transition Function

The next step is to initialize your state transition function. If it implements the StateTransitionRunner interface, you can use that
for easy initialization.

```rust
let mut stf_runner = NativeAppRunner::<Risc0Host>::new(rollup_config);
let mut stf = stf_runner.inner_mut();
```

If your StateTransitionRunner provides an RPC interface, you should initialize that too. If it implements RpcRunner, you
can use that for easy access to RPC:

```rust
let rpc_module = get_rpc_module(stf_runner.get_storage());
let _handle = tokio::spawn(async move {
     start_rpc_server(module, address).await;
});
```

### Step 3: Run the Main Loop

The full node implements a simple loop for processing blocks. The workflow is:

1. Fetch slot data from the DA service
2. Run `stf.begin_slot()`
3. Iterate over the blobs, running `apply_batch`
4. Run `stf.end_slot()`

In this demo, we also keep a `ledger_db`, which stores information
related to the chain's history - batches, transactions, receipts, etc.

## Warning

This is a prototype. It contains known vulnerabilities and should not be used in production under any
circumstances.

## Celestia Integration

The current prototype runs against Celestia-node version `v0.7.1`. This is the version used on the `arabica` testnet
as of Mar 18, 2023.

## Getting Started

### Set up Celestia

Sync a Celestia light node running on the Arabica testnet

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-node.git`.
1. `cd celestia-node`
1. Checkout the code at v0.7.1: `git checkout tags/v0.7.1`
1. Build and install the celestia binary: `make build && make go-install`
1. Build celestia's key management tool `make cel-key`
1. Initialize the node: `celestia light init --p2p.network arabica`
1. Start the node with rpc enabled. Our default config uses port 11111: `celestia light start --core.ip https://limani.celestia-devops.dev --p2p.network arabica --gateway --rpc.port 11111`. If you want to use a different port, you can adjust the rollup's configuration in rollup_config.toml.
1. Obtain a JWT for RPC access: `celestia light auth admin --p2p.network arabica`
1. Copy the JWT and and store it in the `celestia_rpc_auth_token` field of the rollup's config file (`rollup_config.toml`). Be careful to paste the entire JWT - it may wrap across several lines in your terminal.
1. Wait a few minutes for your Celestia node to sync. It needs to have synced to the rollup's configured `start_height `671431` before the demo can run properly.

Once your Celestia node is up and running, simply `cargo +nightly run` to test out the prototype.
